CS114 Project 2: Monte Carlo Integration & Path Tracing
Part 1: Getting familiar with Monte Carlo integration
Part 2: Applying the concept of Monte Carlo integration to solving the rendering equation for implementing path tracing, a common solution to the global illumination problem.

Programming Language: C++
My part: sampling functions, ideal diffuse BRDF, radiance estimator

The result of the project is put in "writeup.pdf".
